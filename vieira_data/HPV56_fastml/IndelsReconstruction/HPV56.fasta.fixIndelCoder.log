Step (1) readSequenceIntoGaps...
 All MSA gaps are sorted by coordinates
 Sort by: I =(i1,i2), K =(k1,k2), I<K iff i1<k1 or i1=k1 and i2<k2

There are 1797 gaps

Step (2) delimitationOfCharacters... Simple Coding (SIC)
 Finding the required positions(=characters) in the coded sequence
 The number of characters <= the number of found gaps (each character may include several gaps)

There were 174 characters

Step (3) determinationCharacterState...

 ---------------------- THE PARAMETERS ----------------------------
Likelihood computation is performed while acounting for un-oberved data
With min number of presences('1's)= 1
With min number of absences('0's)= 0
'Reversible'(Root.freq==stationary.freq) model is used
RootFreq EQ stationary (taken from each sp - gain/(gain+loss) )

inSeq file: /Volumes/Samsung_X5/Val_HPV_evolution/revisions/HPV66_fastml/IndelsReconstruction//HPV66.fasta.fix.indelOutputFastaFile
log: RESULTS//log.txt with level= 5
Optimization of the model parmeters is performed
rate inference method is: empirical Bayesian estimate
using a Gamma prior distribution with: 4 discrete categories
branch lengths are not optimized
rate4site is calculated 
calculePosteriorExpectationOfChange is done Analytically
